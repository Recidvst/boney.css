### Lightweight (5kb) responsive layout template - Barebones %-based calc grid for use as a jumping-off point.

Basic SCSS template built on a variable number of columns set by you. Uses calc and fns to build up the column styles. 
Desktop uses %-based widths and drops on mobile to using breakpoints to resize to default blocky widths (but this needs work).
This is intended to be used as a basic starting point for any responsive web project if you don't want to bother with a big, unwieldy framework.
